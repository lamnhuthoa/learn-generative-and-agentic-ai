# 🤖 AI & LLM Engineering — Hands-on Repository

This repository documents what I have **learned and implemented** while studying modern AI and LLM engineering.

The focus is on **practical system design and hands-on implementation**, not just calling APIs.

## 🧠 Core Skills Acquired

### 🧑‍💻 Programming & Engineering Foundations
Python programming | Structured data validation with Pydantic | Git-based development workflows | Containerized development with Docker & Docker Compose

### 🧩 LLM Fundamentals
How Large Language Models work internally | Tokenization, embeddings, attention, and transformers | Prompt → model → output execution flow | Practical limitations of LLMs (context, hallucinations)

### ✍️ Prompt Engineering
Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting | Chain-of-thought (conceptual understanding) | Persona-based prompts | Structured outputs using schemas

## 🏗️ AI Systems Built

### 📄 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
End-to-end RAG pipelines:
  - Document loading & chunking
  - Embedding generation
  - Vector storage & retrieval
  - Answer generation

RAG systems implemented with LangChain | API-backed RAG services using FastAPI | Scalable RAG patterns using queues and workers

### 🤖 AI Agents
Agents built from scratch | Tool-using agents (LLM + external tools) | CLI-based coding agents | Multi-step reasoning loops (plan → act → observe) | Reliability and failure handling | OpenAI Agent SDK

### 🧭 LangGraph & Stateful AI
Graph-based AI workflows | Explicit state management with nodes and edges | Checkpointing and resumable execution | Long-running, multi-step AI systems

### 🧠 Memory Systems
Short-term and long-term memory concepts | Vector-based semantic memory | Episodic memory patterns | Graph-based memory using Neo4j

### 🎤 Conversational & Multi-Modal AI
Conversational AI systems | Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) | Voice-based AI agents | Multi-modal inputs (text + image)

### 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Understanding MCP and its role in AI systems
